* INSTALLING
Go into =install= folder and execute =main.sh=. The script will overwrite some folders in =~/.config= so make sure to make an backup.

* THEMES
In order to change between themes you need to execute script which should be in =home/.config/scripts/themes/main.sh=. In bspwm and hyprland (if dotfiles were applied correctly) you can bring it up by =super+F6=.

Not everything changes out of the box (like notification daemon and panel) so rebooting or logging out of your machine is recommended after changing theme.

* TODO
- good (for me) neovim config
- adding gtk3 theme changing in bspwm
