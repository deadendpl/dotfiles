At sway's startup the script [[file:.local/bin/pyrice][~/.local/bin/pyrice]] will be executed. It will use a image file as a argument, or a directory and choose random file from there.
You can execute the script from terminal or by pressing =Super+ALT+R= or from script hub by pressing =Super+Shift+Enter=.

* INSTALLING
** DEPENDENCIES
Go to [[file:install/README.org][install/README.org]] to look at the dependencies and other tweaks.
** CONFIG FILES
Copy/move all files to your =$HOME= directory.

Another way to manage this conveniently is to install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]].
1. Move cloned repo into =~/repo-name=.
2. Backup your =~/.config= and delete everything inside if necessary.
3. Inside repo directory do =stow .=
This will link all files automatically to its corresponding places.
