* INSTALLING
Go into =install= folder and execute =arcolinux-repo.sh=. The script will add Arco Linux repos to your =/etc/pacman.conf=.
Then go to =dependencies= directory and window manager you want to use. =pacman.sh= will install standard packages with pacman while =aur.sh= will install AUR packages (it installs them with [[https://github.com/Jguer/yay][yay]]).

After that copy/move all files in =home= directory to your =$HOME= directory.

* TODO PYWAL
I decided to throw away dracula for [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]] because I love material you on android

At hyprland's startup the script =~/.config/scripts/hypr/pywal.sh= will be executed. Go there and edit =walls_dir= variable to your own wallpapers directory.
After that you can exexute the script from terminal or by pressing =Super+ALT+R= or from script hub by pressing =Super+Shift+Enter=.
