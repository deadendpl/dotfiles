This is meant for [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch]] based distros. Though I have WIP nixos config. Dependencies might not be available for other distros.

* PYWAL with hyprland
I decided to throw away dracula for [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]] because I love material you on android

Install dependencies from =install/dependencies/hypr/pywal.txt= with =yay=.
At hyprland's startup the script =~/.local/bin/pyrice= will be executed. Go there and edit =walls_dir= variable to your own wallpapers directory.
After that you can execute the script from terminal or by pressing =Super+ALT+R= or from script hub by pressing =Super+Shift+Enter=.

Stuff to rice [10/11]:
- [X] foot
- [X] rofi (FIXME power menu needs recoloring)
- [X] gtk3 [[https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk][wpgtk]]
- [ ] gtk4
- [X] emacs
- [X] qutebrowser
- [X] waybar
- [X] mako
- [X] nvim
- [X] hyprland
- [X] zathura

* INSTALLING
** DEPENDENCIES
Go into =install= folder and execute =arcolinux-repo.sh=. The script will add Arco Linux repos to your =/etc/pacman.conf=.
Then go to =install/README.org= to look at the dependencies and other tweaks.
** CONFIG FILES
Copy/move all files to your =$HOME= directory.

Another way to manage this conveniently is to install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]].
1. Move cloned repo into =~/.repo-name=.
2. Backup your =~/.config= and delete everything inside if necessary.
3. Then inside that directory do =stow .=
This will link all files autmatically to its corrensponding places
