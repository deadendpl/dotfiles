* INSTALLING
Go into =install= folder and execute =arcolinux-repo.sh=. The script will add Arco Linux repos to your =/etc/pacman.conf=.
Then go to =dependencies= directory and window manager you want to use. =pacman.sh= will install standard packages with pacman while =aur.sh= will install AUR packages (it installs them with [[https://github.com/Jguer/yay][yay]]).

After that copy/move all files in =home= directory to your =$HOME= directory.

* THEMES
In order to change between themes you need to execute script which should be in =home/.config/scripts/themes/main.sh=. In bspwm and hyprland (if dotfiles were applied correctly) you can bring it up by =super+F6=.

Not everything changes instantly (like notification daemon and panel) so rebooting or logging out of your machine is recommended after changing theme.

* TODO TODO [2/3]
- [-] good (for me) neovim config
- [X] adding gtk3 theme changing in bspwm
- [X] (maybe) making main configs as org documents ðŸ—¿
